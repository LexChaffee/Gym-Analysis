# Gym-Analysis
This is an analysis that will break down gym data to find relationships between the variables and see if we can predict calories burned based on predictor variables.

The initial iterations focused more on simple linear regression as well as multiple linear regression. But then stepwise regression was used and an end goal of predicting calories
burned was formed. Then the next iterations focused on making visualizations that could communicate the findings to any audience of choice.
